\section{Introduction}
The objective of this lab is to analyze a given discrete system using Pythonâ€™s built-in functions and a function developed by Christopher Felton. The system we are using in this lab is represented by the following causal function:\\
\includegraphics[]{Capture.PNG}

\section{Equations}
The response function $H(z)$ for the causal function is shown as follows:\\
$$H(z)=\frac{Y(z)}{X(z)}=\frac{2z(z-20)}{z^2-10z+16}$$
And by applying partial fraction expansion we get that:\\
$$H(z)=\frac{6z}{z-2}-\frac{4z}{z-8}$$
Therefore, the taking the inverse z-transformation will result in the following function:\\
$$h[k]=[6(2)^k-4(8)^k]u[k]$$


\section{Methodology}
In order to analyze the given system, we needed to find its response function $h[k]$. To do that, we found the z-transform of the causal function and solved for $H(z)=\frac{Y(z)}{X(z)}$. We then divided both sides by $z$ to use it after applying the partial fraction expansion. After that, we multiplied back the $z$ in both sides and found $h[k]$ by taking the inverse z-transformation of $H(z)$. These steps are mathematically shown below:\\
$$y[k]=2x[k]-40x[k-1]+10y[k-1]-16y[k-2]$$
$$Y(z)(1-10z^{-1}+16z^{-2})=X(z)(2-40z^{-1})$$
$$H(z)=\frac{Y(z)}{X(z)}=\frac{2z(z-20)}{z^2-10z+16}$$
$$\frac{H(z)}{z}=\frac{2(z-20)}{z^2-10z+16}$$
$$\frac{H(z)}{z}=\frac{6}{z-2}-\frac{4}{z-8}$$
$$H(z)=\frac{6z}{z-2}-\frac{4z}{z-8}$$
$$h[k]=[6(2)^k-4(8)^k]u[k]$$

To double check our results for the response function, we used the Python function scipy.signal.residuez() to find the poles and residues for the partial fraction expansion of $H(z)$. The output of this step is shown in the results section.\\

To further our analysis, we used the zplane() function, provided by our TA, to obtain the pole-zero plot for $H(z)$. This plot is shown in Figure 1 under the results section.\\
In addition, we plotted the magnitude and phase for the response function $H(z)$ in Figure 2 using the the built-in function scipy.signal.freqz().

\section{Results}
The residues and poles for the response function $H(z)$ is shown below as:\\
\includegraphics[]{output to task 3.PNG}\\
As we see, this matches the result we gained by taking the partial fraction expansion for $H(z)$. We also see that the absolute value of the poles are greater than 1, $|p|>1$. Therefore, we establish that this system is not stable. To further prove that, we obtained the pole-zero plot for $H(z)$ as:\\
\includegraphics[]{Figure 1.png}\\
We can see that the poles for the response function lie outside of the unit circle, which indicates that the system is unstable.\\

The magnitude and phase responses of $H(z)$ are plotted in figure 2 as shown below:\\
\includegraphics[]{Figure 2.png}\\

\section{Questions}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item 
    Looking at the plot generated in Task 4, is H(z) stable? Explain why or why not.\\
    As discussed in the result section, we can see in figure 1 that the poles for the response function lie outside of the unit circle, which indicates that the system is unstable. This is because the values will not be decaying as $|p|>1$.\\
    
    \item
    Leave any feedback on the clarity of the expectations, instructions, and deliverables.\\
   This lab was clear and good.
    
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
Throughout this lab, we analyzed a discrete system mathematically and graphically using our knowledge gained in the class lectures about z-transformation along with the Python tools provided in this lab.
